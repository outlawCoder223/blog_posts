# What Makes a Good Programmer?

## My story

---

I began programming when my brother introduced me to a device called a PLC (Programmable Logic Controller). In my past life I was familiar with PLC's as they are quite common in the industrial world I was used to being in. As an electrician, I would run wires from these controllers out to the devices they controlled. Once all the wires were run and the power was on, 'people much smarter than me' would come in and program the PLC to control whatever process that they were in charge of.

My brother just happens to be one of these 'people much smarter than me', and last summer I was given two weeks off after we completed one particularly large installation. This was my chance! I went down to Idaho and spent the two weeks learning the basics of programming a PLC, and I was instantly hooked. It was like the ten year old me that wanted to be a hacker all along was awakened inside of me. After that trip I came home and dove into programming.

Several blogposts later, I decided that I would start with Python. It seemed like the thing all the 'experts' were saying to start with, so it seemed logical to begin there. I bought a book on Python, started a Udemy course and wrote a few basic applications. By this point I already knew that programming needed to be my full time job. With this basic Python under my belt, I knew it was time to start researching how I could break onto this scene. Lucky for me there was coding bootcamp in Calgary and I was able to enroll and begin the next step in my journey.

## Evolution

---

As I look back and reflect on my first year of programming, I realize that my views on programming has changed dramatically. Before I had any exposure to programming, I just assumed I wasn't smart enough to ever learn it. And I also didn't have enough time to even try. I broke through that glass ceiling pretty fast. A PLC is not hard to program. Especially compared to an actual web app or piece of software. It turns out that these people I thought were much smarter than me, weren't actually smarter than me. The only thing they had on me was experience. They just put in the time and learned their craft. They were very good at programming PLC to control complex automated processes that would make an average electrician's head spin. So maybe they aren't that smart, or maybe I'm not as dumb as I thought I was? Whatever it was, it has now become clear to me that programming is something that comes over time. It isn't reserved for a high IQ; rather, it gained with hours of dedication.

Once I finally took that initial step and dove into Python, I made another rookie mistake. I started shopping. Maybe I'm the only person to ever do this, but when I start a new hobby, or learn a new skill, all of a sudden I need the best of everything. How could I be a good programer if I didn't have a high tier Macbook Pro with 64gb of RAM etc. Of course I'll need a 32 inch 4k monitor because all the GOOD programmers have them. You aren't a good coder if you don't have a battlestation with 4 monitors and rgb lights everywhere you turn. Of course the DESK! How could I be a good programmer without a cool modern desk. Fortunately for me, I couldn't afford any of this stuff. I learned to program on a very generic Dell. Eventually I did upgrade to an entry level Macbook Pro when I decided I wanted to take my programming further (one of the best purchases I've ever made).

Even to this day I still fall prey to this mindset. I am always looking for a reason to upgrade my laptop, but am too cheap to actually pull the trigger. My desk is an old foldable plastic table my inlaws gave to me. I splurged and bought a Ben Q monitor to add some real estate to my 13" MBP. Once again I didn't break the bank on this upgrade. So what have I learned this year? Maybe there's more to programming than hardware, software, or social media photos.

## So what makes a good dev?

Over the course of my first year as a programmer I've been able to meet some amazing mentors. What made them great wasn't there crazy work from home setups, nor was it there Wikipedia like well of knowledge. The best devs I've met could probably be just as productive on a ten year old laptop as a blazing fast brand new one. The best devs are the ones who have been through the struggle of learning to program. They were great at coding because they had spent a lot of time at the keyboard. When they hit a wall, they sat there until they found a way under, over, or through the wall.

I know I've got a long ways to go on my developer journey, but I'm excited to share this journey together. Maybe by the end of the journey I'll have become a good dev like the many others before me.
